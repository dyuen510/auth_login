This project is started with create-react-app

### `Plan`
In this project we will be using:

### `Auth0`
Auth0 for authenticating the user and assisting with the login process.

### `nodemailer or mailgun`
Also we will be using either nodemailer or mailgun so that we will be able to send user messages directly to our email or sending an email verification to the user. 

### `twilio`
We will also be implementing twilio into our project so that we can have another option for authenticating the user by sending them a code via text message directly to their mobile devices. 

### `database`
For the database we will be using either mongodb or mysql or firebase. Have not concluded which to use yet because each has their pros and cons.
